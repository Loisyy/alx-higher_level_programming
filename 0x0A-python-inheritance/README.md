0x0A. Python - Inheritance



Why Python programming is awesome: Python is appreciated for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It offers a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, making it suitable for various domains such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more. Its syntax emphasizes readability and allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to other languages.

What is a superclass, base class, or parent class: In object-oriented programming, a superclass, base class, or parent class is a class that is extended or inherited by another class, called a subclass or derived class. The superclass provides attributes and methods that are inherited by its subclasses.

What is a subclass: A subclass, also known as a derived class, is a class that inherits attributes and methods from a superclass or base class. It can extend the functionality of the superclass by adding new attributes or methods or by overriding existing ones.

How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance: You can use the dir() function to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance in Python. Additionally, you can use the vars() function to get the dictionary containing the object's attributes and their values.

When can an instance have new attributes: An instance can have new attributes added to it at any time during its lifetime. These attributes can be added dynamically, even if they were not defined in the class definition.

How to inherit a class from another: In Python, you can inherit a class from another by specifying the superclass in parentheses after the subclass name in the class definition. For example: class SubClass(SuperClass):

How to define a class with multiple base classes: To define a class with multiple base classes in Python, you can specify them inside parentheses separated by commas in the class definition. For example: class SubClass(BaseClass1, BaseClass2):

What is the default class every class inherits from: In Python, the default class that every class inherits from is called object. If no superclass is explicitly specified, Python assumes object as the base class.

How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class: To override a method or attribute inherited from the base class in Python, you simply define a method or attribute with the same name in the subclass. This new definition will override the one from the superclass.

Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses: Subclasses inherit all attributes and methods from their superclass(es). They can access and use these inherited attributes and methods as if they were defined within the subclass itself.

What is the purpose of inheritance: Inheritance allows code reusability and promotes a hierarchical structure in object-oriented programming. It enables the creation of new classes that inherit attributes and methods from existing ones, facilitating code organization, maintenance, and extensibility.

What are, when, and how to use isinstance, issubclass, type, and super built-in functions:

isinstance(object, class_or_tuple): Checks if an object is an instance of a class or any of its subclasses.
issubclass(subclass, class_or_tuple): Checks if a class is a subclass of another class or any of its subclasses.
type(object): Returns the type of an object.
super(): Returns a proxy object that delegates method calls to a parent or sibling class of type.
These functions are commonly used in Python for type checking, object-oriented programming, and method resolution. They are helpful in implementing polymorphism, handling inheritance, and ensuring code flexibility and robustness.
